### Donate ###

It is not an insignificant amount of time & resources spent in creating the Xcode keyboard shortcuts updated. Donating helps me free up some time so I can work on the shortcuts and keep it up to date as well as buy software tools specifically to improve them in the future. I don’t plan on ever forcing people to pay money to get the shortcuts, but if you feel it’s worth some $$$ then please feel free to donate.
